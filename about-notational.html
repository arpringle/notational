                        Notational is a simple, free-to-use, accountless note-sharing platform.
                        Simply enter a 6-character <b>NoteCode</b>, consisting of only letters and
                        numbers. For example, AAA123 or 123456. If someone else has posted notes
                        under that code, you will see them there. If not, you can use the space to
                        write some notes of your own!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to note that Notational is <b>insecure-by-design</b>. This
                        means that your notes should not be considered to be private. Anyone with
                        the same code can see your notes, and codes are able to be guessed easily.
                        Only put information you feel comfortable making public on Notational.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you like Notational, you can check out the project on
                        <a href="https://github.com/arpringle/notational">GitHub</a>. It's totally
                        open-source, and you can even self-host it if you want. It's written in PHP,
                        and served as a fun side-project.
